# Field

*A private, local-first infinite canvas for dumping ideas.*

Field is a minimal, performance-first thinking surface.

Paste text, links, or images and they appear instantly on an infinite canvas.
No folders. No tags. No accounts. No cloud.

Everything lives locally in your browser and persists automatically.

- Zero-friction capture
- Mess is allowed
- Local-first and private by default
- Performance over features
- UI stays out of the way

Not a productivity system.
A place ideas land.
